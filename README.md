# Time Synchronization and Periodic Data Collection 
Implementation of a protocol for periodic
data collection. It is based on a schedule that is built to the reduce
the interference between nodes. Results are shown for both
simulation and testbed experiments to assess the performance
of the implementation. It is also quantitatively compared with a
baseline protocol based on transmission with random delays.
